The estimations follow the methodology available in LIS, Key Figures and DART platform.\n\nWe obtain after tax income by using the disposable household income variable (`dhi`).\n\nWe estimate before tax income by calculating the sum of income from labor and capital (variable `hifactor`), cash transfers and in-kind goods and services from privates (`hiprivate`) and private pensions (`hi33`). We do this only for surveys where tax and contributions are fully captured, collected or imputed.\n\nWe convert income data from local currency into international-$ by dividing by the [LIS PPP factor](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/resources/ppp-deflators/), available as an additional database in the LISSY platform.\n\nWe top and bottom-code incomes by replacing negative values with zeros and setting boundaries for extreme values of log income: at the top Q3 plus 3 times the interquartile range (Q3-Q1), and at the bottom Q1 minus 3 times the interquartile range.\n\nWe equivalize incomes by dividing each household observation by the square root of the number of household members (nhhmem). Per capita estimates are calculated by dividing incomes by the number of household members.\n\nWe obtain Gini coefficients by using [Stata’s ineqdec0 function](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s366007.html). We set weights as the product between the number of household members (nhhmem) and the normalized household weight (hwgt).

Per capita estimates are calculated by dividing incomes by the number of household members.\n\nIncome shares and thresholds by decile are obtained by using [Stata’s sumdist function](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s366005.html). We set weights as the product between the number of household members (nhhmem) and the normalized household weight (hwgt) and the number of quantile groups as 10. We estimate threshold ratios, share ratios and averages by decile in Python after processing in the LISSY platform.	international-$ in 2017 prices	$	10000;20000;50000;100000;200000;500000	Greens	multiplyBy avg_p100_mi_pc 1	Luxembourg Income Study (2024)	Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) Database, http://www.lisdatacenter.org (multiple countries; June 2024).
