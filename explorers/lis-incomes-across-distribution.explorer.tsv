	Richest decile (before tax)	avg_p100_mi_pc_year	Numeric	The mean income per year within the richest decile (tenth of the population).\n\nIncome is ‘pre-tax’ — measured before taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.\n\nIncome is per capita, which means that household income is divided by the total number of household members.\n\nThe data is measured in international-$ at 2017 prices – this adjusts for inflation and for differences in the cost of living between countries.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nThe Luxembourg Income Study data is created from standardized household survey microdata available in their [LISSY platform](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/).
