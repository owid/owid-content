Because the total number of IDPs includes people displaced in previous years and still living in internal displacement, the number can be higher than the number of new movements within a year.\n- We group movements of people triggered by disasters into two categories: weather-related and geophysical. Based on EM-DAT, the international disaster database of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, we categorize displacements according to more than 20 different hazard types. Weather-related displacements, for example, include hazards such as floods, droughts, landslides, storms – including cyclones and other storms –, wildfires and extreme temperatures. Geophysical displacements include, for example, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and landslides.', [], '- The share of internally displaced people of the total population is calculated as the number of internally displaced people in a country divided by the total population of the country, multiplied by 100. For this calculation we use our long-term population data set, which can be explored in the [population data explorer](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/population-and-demography).']	RdBu	0	true

Internal displacement describes the movement of a person who is forced to leave their home but who remains within their country's borders. One person can be displaced multiple times within a year and is then counted multiple times in the data.	Our World in Data, based on Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (2024)	https://www.internal-displacement.org/database/displacement-data/	displacements		Numeric	2024-08-02	['- An internal displacement refers to each new forced movement of a person within the borders of the country of their habitual residence recorded during the year. The same person or people can be displaced several times over a given period before finding a solution to their displacement. We count each time a person is forced to move as an internal displacement. This figure illustrates dynamics of displacement in a specific crisis.\nGiven the challenges in tracking population movements, it is difficult to determine what portion of internal displacements refer to people being displaced for the first time and what portion represents the same people being displaced a second, third, fourth or fifth time. As a result, internal displacements could include secondary or multiple displacement movements.\nThe number of internal displacements within a specific year is usually higher than the increase in the number of internally displaced people from one year to another. The number of internal displacements includes movements of newly displaced people as well as repeated and multiple movements of people already living in displacement.\n- We track internal displacements triggered by conflict and violence [..], this includes international armed conflict, non-international armed conflict, communal violence, crime-related violence, civilian-state violence and other forms of violence.
