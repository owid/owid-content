	Share in relative poverty (World Bank PIP)	headcount_ratio_50_median	Numeric	The share of population with after tax income or consumption below 50% of the median.

To calculate this metric we take the median income or consumption for the country and year, calculate a relative poverty line – in this case 50% of the median – and then run a specific query on the PIP API to return the share of population below that line.\n\nFor a small number of country-year observations, the World Bank PIP data contains two estimates: one based on income data and one based on consumption data.
