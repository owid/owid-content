	Share in relative poverty (World Bank PIP)	headcount_ratio_50_median	Numeric	The share of population with after tax income or consumption below 50% of the median. Relative poverty reflects the extent of inequality within the bottom of the distribution.\n\nThis is a measure of _relative_ poverty – it captures the share of people whose income is low by the standards typical in their own country.\n\nDepending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nRegional and global estimates are extrapolated up until the year of the data release using GDP growth estimates and forecasts.

To calculate this metric we take the median income or consumption for the country and year, calculate a relative poverty line – in this case 50% of the median – and then run a specific query on the PIP API to return the share of population below that line.\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years.
