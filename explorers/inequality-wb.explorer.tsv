A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries and metrics. In choosing which data points to drop, we try to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. As such, the exact approach varies somewhat across countries.\n\nIf you would like to see the original data with _all_ available income and consumption data points shown separately, you can do so by selecting _Income surveys only_ or _Consumption surveys only_ in the Household survey data type dropdown or by clicking on _Show breaks between less comparable surveys_.

	Consumption surveys	consumption_spell_1	Numeric	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (2024)	The income of the richest decile (tenth of the population) as a share of total income.\n\nThe data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years. A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries and metrics. In choosing which data points to drop, we try to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. As such, the exact approach varies somewhat across countries.\n\nIf you would like to see the original data with _all_ available income and consumption data points shown separately, you can do so by selecting _Income surveys only_ or _Consumption surveys only_ in the Household survey data type dropdown or by clicking on _Show breaks between less comparable surveys_.

	Consumption surveys	consumption_spell_1	Numeric	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (2024)	The consumption of the richest decile (tenth of the population) as a share of total consumption.\n\nThe data relates to consumption per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years. A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries and metrics. In choosing which data points to drop, we try to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. As such, the exact approach varies somewhat across countries.\n\nIf you would like to see the original data with _all_ available income and consumption data points shown separately, you can do so by selecting _Income surveys only_ or _Consumption surveys only_ in the Household survey data type dropdown or by clicking on _Show breaks between less comparable surveys_.

	Consumption surveys	consumption_spell_1	Numeric	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (2024)	The Palma ratio is a measure of inequality that divides the share received by the richest 10% by the share of the poorest 40%. Higher values indicate higher inequality.\n\nDepending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years. A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country.

	Income surveys	income_spell_7	Numeric	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (2024)	The Palma ratio is a measure of inequality that divides the share received by the richest 10% by the share of the poorest 40%. Higher values indicate higher inequality.\n\nDepending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years. A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries and metrics. In choosing which data points to drop, we try to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. As such, the exact approach varies somewhat across countries.\n\nIf you would like to see the original data with _all_ available income and consumption data points shown separately, you can do so by selecting _Income surveys only_ or _Consumption surveys only_ in the Household survey data type dropdown or by clicking on _Show breaks between less comparable surveys_.

	Income surveys	income_spell_6	Numeric	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (2024)	The Palma ratio is a measure of inequality that divides the share received by the richest 10% by the share of the poorest 40%. Higher values indicate higher inequality.\n\nThe data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years. A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries and metrics. In choosing which data points to drop, we try to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. As such, the exact approach varies somewhat across countries.\n\nIf you would like to see the original data with _all_ available income and consumption data points shown separately, you can do so by selecting _Income surveys only_ or _Consumption surveys only_ in the Household survey data type dropdown or by clicking on _Show breaks between less comparable surveys_.

	Income surveys	income_spell_5	Numeric	World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (2024)	The Palma ratio is a measure of inequality that divides the share received by the richest 10% by the share of the poorest 40%.
