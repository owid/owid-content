	Poverty gap index - $1 a day (PIP data)	poverty_gap_index_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.\n\nDepending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita.

	Poverty gap index - $30 a day (PIP data)	poverty_gap_index_3000	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $30 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.\n\nDepending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nRegional and global estimates are extrapolated up until the year of the data release using GDP growth estimates and forecasts. For more details about the methodology, please refer to the [World Bank PIP documentation](https://datanalytics.worldbank.org/PIP-Methodology/lineupestimates.html#nowcasts).\n\nThe data is measured in international-$ at 2017 prices – this adjusts for inflation and for differences in living costs between countries.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years. A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country.

However this is not a measure of the actual cost of eliminating poverty, since it does not take into account the costs involved in making the necessary transfers nor any changes in behaviour they would bring about.\n\nThis is a measure of _relative_ poverty – it captures the share of people whose income is low by the standards typical in their own country.\n\nDepending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nRegional and global estimates are extrapolated up until the year of the data release using GDP growth estimates and forecasts.

To calculate this metric we take the median income or consumption for the country and year, calculate a relative poverty line – in this case 50% of the median – and then run a specific query on the PIP API to return the share of population below that line.\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years. A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries and metrics. In choosing which data points to drop, we try to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible.

	Poverty gap index - 40% of median (PIP data)	poverty_gap_index_40_median	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income or consumption. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.\n\nThis is a measure of _relative_ poverty – it captures the share of people whose income is low by the standards typical in their own country.\n\nDepending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita.

	Poverty gap index - $1 a day (LIS data)	poverty_gap_index_dhi_pc_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.\n\nIncome is 'post-tax' — measured after taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.\n\nIncome is per capita, which means that household income is divided by the total number of household members.\n\nThe data is measured in international-$ at 2017 prices – this adjusts for inflation and for differences in living costs between countries.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nWe create the Luxembourg Income Study data from standardized household survey microdata available in their [LISSY platform](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/).

	Poverty gap index - $2.15 a day (LIS data)	poverty_gap_index_dhi_pc_215	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $2.15 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.\n\nIncome is 'post-tax' — measured after taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.\n\nIncome is per capita, which means that household income is divided by the total number of household members.\n\nThe data is measured in international-$ at 2017 prices – this adjusts for inflation and for differences in living costs between countries.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nWe create the Luxembourg Income Study data from standardized household survey microdata available in their [LISSY platform](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/).

	Poverty gap index - 40% of median (LIS data)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_dhi_pc	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line.

For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

	Poverty gap index - $1 a day (LIS data)	poverty_gap_index_mi_pc_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

	Poverty gap index - 40% of median (LIS data)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_mi_pc	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.
