This is the amount of money that would be theoretically needed to lift the income or consumption of all people in poverty up to the poverty line. However this is not a measure of the actual cost of eliminating poverty, since it does not take into account the costs involved in making the necessary transfers nor any changes in behaviour they would bring about.\n\nDepending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or consumption, per capita.\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nMeasures of relative poverty are not directly available in the World Bank PIP data. To calculate this metric we take the median income or consumption for the country and year, calculate a relative poverty line – in this case 60% of the median – and then run a specific query on the PIP API to return the share of population below that line.\n\nFor a small number of country-year observations, the World Bank PIP data contains two estimates: one based on income data and one based on consumption data.

	Poverty gap index - 40% of median (PIP data)	poverty_gap_index_40_median	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income or consumption. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty.

	Poverty gap index - $1 a day (LIS data)	poverty_gap_index_dhi_pc_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

	Poverty gap index - 40% of median (LIS data)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_dhi_pc	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

	Poverty gap index - 40% of median (LIS data)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_mi_pc	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.
