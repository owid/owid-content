Model Dev. 11, 369-408, 2018.\n\nThe authors combine data on energy and industrial production, the breakdown of fuel sources (for example, coal, light oil, biomass) and integrated emission factors - which provide estimates of the amount of each pollutant that is produced per unit of energy production - to estimate total emissions of several local air pollutants.\n\nThe original from CEDS provides this data on total emissions by air pollutant, and the breakdown by sector. Our World in Data have also provided this data on a per capita basis by dividing total emissions by the population of each country or region. These population adjustments were made based on our long-term population dataset sourced from Gapminder, HYDE and the UN Population Division.\n\nThis dataset is typically updated annually from the underlying data source.

J., Mott, A., Ahsan, H., McDuffie, E. E., Crippa, M., Klimont, S., McDonald, B., Z., Wang, Nicholson, M. B, Feng, L., and Hoesly, R. M. (2021, February 05).

The Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) provide long-term estimates of emissions of air pollutants based on historical reconstructions of energy production, fuel sources, and industrial outputs.\n\nThe methodology for these estimates is laid out in the publication by Hoesly et al. (2018): Hoesly et al, Historical (1750-2014) anthropogenic emissions of reactive gases and aerosols from the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS). Geosci. Model Dev. 11, 369-408, 2018.\n\nThe authors combine data on energy and industrial production, the breakdown of fuel sources (for example, coal, light oil, biomass) and integrated emission factors - which provide estimates of the amount of each pollutant that is produced per unit of energy production - to estimate total emissions of several local air pollutants.\n\nThe original from CEDS provides this data on total emissions by air pollutant, and the breakdown by sector. Our World in Data have also provided this data on a per capita basis by dividing total emissions by the population of each country or region. These population adjustments were made based on our long-term population dataset sourced from Gapminder, HYDE and the UN Population Division.\n\nThis dataset is typically updated annually from the underlying data source.

Model Dev. 11, 369-408, 2018.\n\nThe authors combine data on energy and industrial production, the breakdown of fuel sources (for example, coal, light oil, biomass) and integrated emission factors - which provide estimates of the amount of each pollutant that is produced per unit of energy production - to estimate total emissions of several local air pollutants.\n\nThe original from CEDS provides this data on total emissions by air pollutant, and the breakdown by sector. Our World in Data have also provided this data on a per capita basis by dividing total emissions by the population of each country or region. These population adjustments were made based on our long-term population dataset sourced from Gapminder, HYDE and the UN Population Division.\n\nThis dataset is typically updated annually from the underlying data source.

Model Dev. 11, 369-408, 2018.\n\nThe authors combine data on energy and industrial production, the breakdown of fuel sources (for example, coal, light oil, biomass) and integrated emission factors - which provide estimates of the amount of each pollutant that is produced per unit of energy production - to estimate total emissions of several local air pollutants.\n\nThe original from CEDS provides this data on total emissions by air pollutant, and the breakdown by sector. Our World in Data have also provided this data on a per capita basis by dividing total emissions by the population of each country or region. These population adjustments were made based on our long-term population dataset sourced from Gapminder, HYDE and the UN Population Division.\n\nThis dataset is typically updated annually from the underlying data source.

The Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) provide long-term estimates of emissions of air pollutants based on historical reconstructions of energy production, fuel sources, and industrial outputs.\n\nThe methodology for these estimates is laid out in the publication by Hoesly et al. (2018): Hoesly et al, Historical (1750-2014) anthropogenic emissions of reactive gases and aerosols from the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS). Geosci. Model Dev. 11, 369-408, 2018.\n\nThe authors combine data on energy and industrial production, the breakdown of fuel sources (for example, coal, light oil, biomass) and integrated emission factors - which provide estimates of the amount of each pollutant that is produced per unit of energy production - to estimate total emissions of several local air pollutants.\n\nThe original from CEDS provides this data on total emissions by air pollutant, and the breakdown by sector. Our World in Data have also provided this data on a per capita basis by dividing total emissions by the population of each country or region. These population adjustments were made based on our long-term population dataset sourced from Gapminder, HYDE and the UN Population Division.\n\nThis dataset is typically updated annually from the underlying data source.

(2017) 	2022-06-02	Population-weighted exposure to ambient PM2.5 pollution is defined as the average level of exposure of a nation's population to concentrations of suspended particles measuring less than 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter, which are capable of penetrating deep into the respiratory tract and causing severe health damage. Exposure is calculated by weighting mean annual concentrations of PM2.5 by population in both urban and rural areas.\n\nLimitations and exceptions: Pollutant concentrations are sensitive to local conditions, and even monitoring sites in the same city may register different levels. Direct monitoring of PM2.5 is still rare in most parts of the world, and measurement protocols and standards are not the same for all countries. These data should be considered only a general indication of air quality, intended to inform cross-country comparisons of the health risks due to particulate matter pollution. The guideline set by the World Health Organization (WHO) for PM2.5 is that annual mean concentrations should not exceed 10 micrograms per cubic meter, representing the lower range over which adverse health effects have been observed. The WHO has also recommended guideline values for emissions of PM2.5 from burning fuels in households.\n\nStatistical concept and methodology: A. van Donkelaar, R.V. Martin, M. Brauer, N.C. Hsu, R.A.

Data integration for the assessment of population exposure to ambient air pollution for global burden of disease assessment. Environ Sci Technol. 2018 Jun 29. Data provided by Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, Seattle. Data on exposure to ambient air pollution are derived from estimates of annual concentrations of very fine particulates produced by the Global Burden of Disease study, an international scientific effort led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Estimates of annual concentrations are generated by combining data from atmospheric chemistry transport models, satellite observations of aerosols in the atmosphere, and ground-level monitoring of particulates. Exposure to concentrations of PM2.5 in both urban and rural areas is weighted by population and is aggregated at the national level.			OrRd	5,,;10,,;15,,;20,,;30,,;40,,;50,,;100,,;150,,;200
