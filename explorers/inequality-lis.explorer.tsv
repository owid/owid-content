	Gini coefficient (after tax)	gini_dhi_eq	Numeric	The Gini coefficient measures inequality on a scale from 0 to 1. Higher values indicate higher inequality.\n\nIncome is ‘post-tax’ — measured after taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.\n\nIncome has been equivalized – adjusted to account for the fact that people in the same household can share costs like rent and heating.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nWe create the Luxembourg Income Study data from standardized household survey microdata available in their [LISSY platform](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/). The estimations follow the methodology available in LIS, Key Figures and DART platform.\n\nWe obtain after tax income by using the disposable household income variable (`dhi`).\n\nWe estimate before tax income by calculating the sum of income from labor and capital (variable `hifactor`), cash transfers and in-kind goods and services from privates (`hiprivate`) and private pensions (`hi33`). We do this only for surveys where tax and contributions are fully captured, collected or imputed.\n\nWe convert income data from local currency into international-$ by dividing by the [LIS PPP factor](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/resources/ppp-deflators/), available as an additional database in the LISSY platform.\n\nWe top and bottom-code incomes by replacing negative values with zeros and setting boundaries for extreme values of log income: at the top Q3 plus 3 times the interquartile range (Q3-Q1), and at the bottom Q1 minus 3 times the interquartile range.\n\nWe equivalize incomes by dividing each household observation by the square root of the number of household members (nhhmem). Per capita estimates are calculated by dividing incomes by the number of household members.\n\nWe obtain Gini coefficients by using [Stata’s ineqdec0 function](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s366007.html). We set weights as the product between the number of household members (nhhmem) and the normalized household weight (hwgt).

We set weights as the product between the number of household members (nhhmem) and the normalized household weight (hwgt). The function generates FGT(0) and FGT(1), headcount ratio and poverty gap index. After extraction, we do further data processing steps to estimate other poverty indicators using these values, population and poverty lines for absolute and relative poverty.	%	%	15;20;25;30;35	100.0	YlOrBr	Luxembourg Income Study (2024)	Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) Database, http://www.lisdatacenter.org (multiple countries; June 2024).
