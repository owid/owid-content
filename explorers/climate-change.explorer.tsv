It is measured in 10²² joules. For reference, 10²² joules are equal to approximately 17 times the amount of energy used globally every year.	false	auto	owid-distinct	LineChart	false	Heat content is shown for four sources: Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and Meteorological Research Institute (MRI).	https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/climate-change	Data explorer: how is the Earth's climate changing?
