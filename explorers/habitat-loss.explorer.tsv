	Projected habitat loss for all species in 2050: Business-as-usual	Projected habitat loss for mammal, bird and amphibian species by 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario. This assumes population growth from UN medium projections; crop yield increases in line with historical rates of improvement; and dietary changes in line with projected rises in income.

	Projected habitat loss for all species in 2050: Combined interventions	Projected habitat loss for mammal, bird and amphibian species by 2050 if all approaches are combined: (1) closing yield gaps; (2) halving food waste; (3) global adoption of healthy diets in line with nutritional requirements; and (4) the optimisation of agricultural production to avoid the most at-risk locations for habitat loss.

	Projected habitat loss for all species in 2050: Adoption of healthy diets	Projected habitat loss for mammal, bird and amphibian species by 2050 under a scenario of global adoption of healthier diets. Diets transition to the EAT-Lancet diet which is in line with healthy calorie and nutritional requirements. For richer countries this would mean a reduction (but not elimination) of meat consumption. For poorer countries, this would mean an increase.	Species habitat loss	All vertebrates	Adoption of healthy diets	habitat	diets_habitat_loss_all	false		owid-distinct	DiscreteBar	true		Williams, D.

	Projected habitat loss for all species in 2050: Halve food waste	Projected habitat loss for mammal, bird and amphibian species by 2050 under a scenario where consumer food waste and food losses in supply chains are reduced by 25% by 2030 and 50% by 2050.

	Projected habitat loss for all species in 2050: Optimize trade	Projected habitat loss for mammal, bird and amphibian species by 2050 under a scenario where agricultural production and trade is optimized to produce food in the locations with the least risk of habitat loss.

The goal of this scenario is to estimate the impact on biodiversity of land-use planning across international borders, avoiding expansion in the most at-risk countries. This scenario would be in conflict with food security and sovereignty, especially in countries where agriculture is a large source of income.

Projected species' habitat loss is projected to 2050 under a business-as-usual, plus five intervention scenarios with changes to diets or agricultural production.\n\nBusiness-as-usual: This assumes population growth from UN medium projections; crop yield increases in line with historical rates of improvement; and dietary changes in line with projected rises in income.\n\nClosing yield gaps: Yields increase linearly from current yields to 80% of the estimated maximum potential by 2050. Increasing yields above 80% is rarely achieved over large areas.\n\nHalve food waste: consumer food waste and food losses in supply chains are reduced by 25% by 2030 and 50% by 2050.\n\nHealthier diets: Diets transition to the EAT-Lancet diet which is in line with healthy calorie and nutritional requirements. For richer countries this would mean a reduction (but not elimination) of meat consumption.
