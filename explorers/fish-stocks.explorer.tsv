	Fish stocks relative to the maximum sustainable yield	Fish stocks are measured by their biomass: the number of individuals multiplied by their mass.\nHere it's measured as the biomass of a fish stock divided by the biomass at its maximum sustainable yield – the level at which we can catch the maximum amount of fish without a decline in fish populations. A value of one maximises fish catch without decreasing fish populations.	Fish stocks (biomass)	Relative to Max Sustainable Yield	fish	total_biomass_relative_to_msy	false	0		LineChart
	Fish stocks relative to the management target	Fish stocks are measured by their biomass: the number of individuals multiplied by their mass.\nHere it's measured as the biomass of a fish stock divided by the biomass at the management target level. A value of one means fish catch is optimal to achieve the intended level fo fish stocks.

	Fishing intensity relative to the maximum sustainable yield	Fishing intensity measured the extent to which a stock is being exploited. This is the fraction of the fish population that is caught in a given year.\nHere it's measured as the intensity divided by the intensity at the maximum sustainable yield – the level at which we can catch the maximum amount of fish without a decline in fish populations. A value of one is the optimal level to maximize fish catch without declining populations. Greater than one suggests overfishing.
