	Poverty gap index - $1 a day (after tax)	poverty_gap_index_dhi_eq_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>Income is ‘post-tax’ — measured after taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.<br><br>Income has been equivalized – adjusted to account for the fact that people in the same household can share costs like rent and heating.<br><br>The data is measured in international-$ at 2017 prices – this adjusts for inflation and for differences in the cost of living between countries.<br><br>NOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR<br><br>The Luxembourg Income Study data is created from standardized household survey microdata available in their <a href='https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/'>LISSY platform</a>.

	Poverty gap index - $5 a day (after tax)	poverty_gap_index_dhi_eq_500	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $5 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty.

	Poverty gap index - 40% of median (after tax)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_dhi_eq	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>Income is ‘post-tax’ — measured after taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.<br><br>Income has been equivalized – adjusted to account for the fact that people in the same household can share costs like rent and heating.<br><br>NOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR<br><br>The Luxembourg Income Study data is created from standardized household survey microdata available in their <a href='https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/'>LISSY platform</a>.

	Poverty gap index - $1 a day (after tax)	poverty_gap_index_dhi_pc_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>Income is ‘post-tax’ — measured after taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.<br><br>Household income is divided by the total number of household members.<br><br>The data is measured in international-$ at 2017 prices – this adjusts for inflation and for differences in the cost of living between countries.<br><br>NOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR<br><br>The Luxembourg Income Study data is created from standardized household survey microdata available in their <a href='https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/'>LISSY platform</a>.

	Poverty gap index - 40% of median (after tax)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_dhi_pc	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>Income is ‘post-tax’ — measured after taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.<br><br>Household income is divided by the total number of household members.<br><br>NOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR<br><br>The Luxembourg Income Study data is created from standardized household survey microdata available in their <a href='https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/'>LISSY platform</a>.

	Poverty gap index - 50% of median (after tax)	poverty_gap_index_50_median_dhi_pc	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 50% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>Income is ‘post-tax’ — measured after taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.<br><br>Household income is divided by the total number of household members.<br><br>NOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR<br><br>The Luxembourg Income Study data is created from standardized household survey microdata available in their <a href='https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/'>LISSY platform</a>.

	Poverty gap index - $1 a day (before tax)	poverty_gap_index_mi_eq_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

	Poverty gap index - 40% of median (before tax)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_mi_eq	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

	Poverty gap index - $1 a day (before tax)	poverty_gap_index_mi_pc_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

	Poverty gap index - $2 a day (before tax)	poverty_gap_index_mi_pc_200	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $2 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero.

	Poverty gap index - 40% of median (before tax)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_mi_pc	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.<br><br>Income is ‘pre-tax’ — measured before taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.<br><br>Household income is divided by the total number of household members.<br><br>NOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR<br><br>The Luxembourg Income Study data is created from standardized household survey microdata available in their <a href='https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/'>LISSY platform</a>.
