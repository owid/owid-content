This is done only for surveys where tax and contributions are fully captured, collected or imputed.\n\nIncome data is converted from local currency into international-$ by dividing by the [LIS PPP factor](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/resources/ppp-deflators/), available as an additional database in the system.\n\nIncomes are top and bottom-coded by replacing negative values with zeros and setting boundaries for extreme values of log income: at the top Q3 plus 3 times the interquartile range (Q3-Q1), and at the bottom Q1 minus 3 times the interquartile range.\n\nIncomes are equivalized by dividing each household observation by the square root of the number of household members (nhhmem). Per capita estimates are calculated by dividing incomes by the number of household members.\n\nPoverty indicators are obtained by using [Stata’s povdeco function](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s366004.html). Weights are set as the product between the number of household members (nhhmem) and the normalized household weight (hwgt). The function generates FGT(0) and FGT(1), headcount ratio and poverty gap index. After extraction, further data processing steps are done to estimate other poverty indicators using these values, population and poverty lines for absolute and relative poverty.	%	%	3;10;20;30;40;50;60;70;80;90;100	OrRd		Luxembourg Income Study (2023)	Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) Database, http://www.lisdatacenter.org (multiple countries; 1967-2021).

	Poverty gap index - $1 a day (after tax)	poverty_gap_index_dhi_eq_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day.

	Poverty gap index - $10 a day (after tax)	poverty_gap_index_dhi_eq_1000	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $10 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

	Poverty gap index - 40% of median (after tax)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_dhi_eq	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.\n\nIncome is ‘post-tax’ — measured after taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.\n\nIncome has been equivalized – adjusted to account for the fact that people in the same household can share costs like rent and heating.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nThe Luxembourg Income Study data is created from standardized household survey microdata available in their [LISSY platform](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/).

	Poverty gap index - $1 a day (after tax)	poverty_gap_index_dhi_pc_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

	Poverty gap index - 40% of median (after tax)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_dhi_pc	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.\n\nIncome is ‘post-tax’ — measured after taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.\n\nIncome is per capita, which means that household income is divided by the total number of household members.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nThe Luxembourg Income Study data is created from standardized household survey microdata available in their [LISSY platform](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/).

	Poverty gap index - $1 a day (before tax)	poverty_gap_index_mi_eq_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty.

	Poverty gap index - $10 a day (before tax)	poverty_gap_index_mi_eq_1000	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $10 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.\n\nIncome is ‘pre-tax’ — measured before taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.\n\nIncome has been equivalized – adjusted to account for the fact that people in the same household can share costs like rent and heating.\n\nThe data is measured in international-$ at 2017 prices – this adjusts for inflation and for differences in the cost of living between countries.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nThe Luxembourg Income Study data is created from standardized household survey microdata available in their [LISSY platform](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/).

	Poverty gap index - 40% of median (before tax)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_mi_eq	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.\n\nIncome is ‘pre-tax’ — measured before taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.\n\nIncome has been equivalized – adjusted to account for the fact that people in the same household can share costs like rent and heating.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nThe Luxembourg Income Study data is created from standardized household survey microdata available in their [LISSY platform](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/).

	Poverty gap index - $1 a day (before tax)	poverty_gap_index_mi_pc_100	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.

	Poverty gap index - 40% of median (before tax)	poverty_gap_index_40_median_mi_pc	Numeric	The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of 40% of the median income. The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and expressed as a percentage of the poverty line. It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line. Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty they experience.\n\nIncome is ‘pre-tax’ — measured before taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.\n\nIncome is per capita, which means that household income is divided by the total number of household members.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nThe Luxembourg Income Study data is created from standardized household survey microdata available in their [LISSY platform](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/data-access/lissy/).
