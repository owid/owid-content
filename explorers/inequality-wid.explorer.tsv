	Gini coefficient (after tax)	p0p100_gini_posttax_nat	Numeric	The Gini coefficient measures inequality on a scale from 0 to 1. Higher values indicate higher inequality.\n\nIncome is 'post-tax' — measured after taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.\n\nThe data is estimated from a combination of household surveys, tax records and national accounts data. This combination can provide a more accurate picture of the incomes of the richest, which tend to be captured poorly in household survey data alone.\n\nThese underlying data sources are not always available. For some countries, observations are extrapolated from data relating to other years, or are sometimes modeled based on data observed in other countries. For more information on this methodology, see this related [technical note](https://wid.world/document/countries-with-regional-income-imputations-on-wid-world-world-inequality-lab-technical-note-2021-15/).\n\nIn the case of national post-tax income, when the data sources are not available, distributions are constructed by using the more widely available pre-tax distributions, combined with tax revenue and government expenditure aggregates. This method is described in more detail in this [technical note](https://wid.world/document/preliminary-estimates-of-global-posttax-income-distributions-world-inequality-lab-technical-note-2023-02/).			0.3;0.35;0.4;0.45;0.5;0.55;0.6;0.65;0.7	1.0	true	Oranges	World Inequality Database (WID.world) (2025)	World Inequality Database (WID), https://wid.world	https://wid.world	5
