	Gini coefficient (PIP data)	gini	Numeric	The Gini coefficient measures inequality on a scale from 0 to 1. Higher values indicate higher inequality.\n\nDepending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years. A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries and metrics. In choosing which data points to drop, we try to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. As such, the exact approach varies somewhat across countries.\n\nIf you would like to see the original data with _all_ available income and consumption data points shown separately, you can do so in our [Inequality - World Bank Data Explorer](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/inequality-wb?country=ROU~CHN~BLR~PER&Indicator=Gini+coefficient&Household+survey+data+type=Show+data+from+both+income+and+consumption+surveys&Show+breaks+between+less+comparable+surveys=true).

	Share in relative poverty (PIP data)	headcount_ratio_50_median	Numeric	The share of population with after tax income or consumption below 50% of the median.\n\nThis is a measure of _relative_ poverty – it captures the share of people whose income is low by the standards typical in their own country.\n\nDepending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nMeasures of relative poverty are not directly available in the World Bank PIP data. To calculate this metric we take the median income or consumption for the country and year, calculate a relative poverty line – in this case 50% of the median – and then run a specific query on the PIP API to return the share of population below that line.\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years.

	Gini coefficient (WID data)	p0p100_gini_posttax_nat	Numeric	The Gini coefficient measures inequality on a scale from 0 to 1.
