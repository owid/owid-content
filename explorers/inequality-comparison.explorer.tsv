	Gini coefficient (after tax)	gini p0p100_gini_posttax_nat gini_dhi_pc	Gini coefficient	After tax	The Gini coefficient measures inequality on a scale from 0 to 1. Higher values indicate higher inequality. The definition of income varies across the data sources.	LIS data refers to disposable household income per capita, WID data to net national income after tax per adult, and, depending on the country and year, PIP data refers to income measured after taxes and benefits, or consumption, per capita.		poverty_inequality	0	2019	entity	false	chart			true
