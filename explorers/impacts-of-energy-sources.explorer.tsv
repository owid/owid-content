	Greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity	Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions measure amount of total greenhouse gases emitted over a technology's full supply chain. This includes emissions from the burning of fuels, in addition to those generated through the mining of materials, and production of energy technologies. This is measured per megawatt-hour of electricity.	Greenhouse gas emissions		energy	ghg_emissions	false		owid-distinct	DiscreteBar	false
	Land use per unit of electricity	Land use is measured as the total amount of land needed per unit of electricity production. This includes direct land use – the land used by a power plant, or solar farm – plus indirect land use from the mining of fuels and materials. This is measured in per megawatt-hour of electricity production.	Land use		energy	land_use_energy	false		owid-distinct	DiscreteBar	false			This is shown as the average land use of different energy technologies. There can be significant variability depending on location, materials, and infrastructure decisions. See our related article for the full range of land use comparisons.	https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-per-energy-source	How does the land use of different energy sources compare?
	Dissipated water use per unit of electricity	Dissipated water is water that is not immediately returned to the local environment.

This is based on literature review of life-cycle assessments of electricity sources: these not only include the direct impacts of an electricity source (for example, the land used for individual power plants) but also include any supply chain inputs (for example, land use upstream in supply chains, such as mining for fuel or raw materials.\nThis meta-analysis included measurements across all regions; here we present the global average across these values.\nNote that for some impacts – land use, for example – there can be significant differences in the maximum and minimum values for a given source depending on context, such as the climate of a given location; choices around spacing and density of electricity sources etc.\nReferences: UNECE (2021).

	death_per_twh	Death rates	Numeric	deaths per TWh					Markandya & Wilkinson (2007); Sovacool et al. (2016)		Markandya & Wilkinson (2007); Sovacool et al. (2016)			Death rates from energy production is measured as the number of deaths by energy source per terawatt-hour (TWh) of production.\nThis data combines two sources: Markandya, A., & Wilkinson, P. (2007) assessed the death rates from accidents and air pollution major energy sources (fossil fuels, nuclear and biomass). Sovacool et al. (2016) assessed death rates from accidents from low-carbon energy sources (nuclear and renewables) based on historical records spanning the period 1990 to 2013.\nWhen we try to combine the two analyses referenced earlier, one issue we encounter is that neither study includes both of the major nuclear accidents in its death rate figure: Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) was published before the Fukushima disaster in 2011; and Sovacool et al. (2016) only look at death rates since 1990, and therefore do not include the 1986 Chernobyl accident. We have therefore reconstructed the death rate for nuclear to include both of these accidents.\nFor Chernobyl, there are several death estimates. We rely on the estimate published by the World Health Organization (WHO) – the most-widely cited figure – although this is considered to be too high by several researchers, including a later report by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR). The WHO estimates that 4000 people have, or will die, from the Chernobyl disaster. This includes the death of 31 people as a direct result of the disaster and those expected to die at a later date from cancers due to radiation exposure.\nThe disaster in Fukushima killed 574 people. In 2018, the Japanese government reported that one worker has since died from lung cancer as a result of exposure from the event. No one died directly from the Fukushima disaster. Instead, most people died as a result of evacuation procedures. According to Japanese authorities 573 people died due to the impact of the evacuation and stress.\nTo the death toll of history’s two nuclear disasters we have added the death rate that Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) estimated for occupational deaths, most from milling and mining. Their published rate is 0.022 deaths per TWh.\nThe sum of these three data points gives us a death rate of 0.07 deaths per TWh.\nFull references to the underlying studies can be found here:\nSovacool, B.
