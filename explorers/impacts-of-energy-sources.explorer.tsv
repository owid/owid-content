	death_per_twh	Death rates	Numeric	deaths per TWh					Markandya & Wilkinson (2007); Sovacool et al. (2016)		Markandya & Wilkinson (2007); Sovacool et al. (2016)			Death rates from energy production is measured as the number of deaths by energy source per terawatt-hour (TWh) of production.<p>This data combines two sources: Markandya, A., & Wilkinson, P. (2007) assessed the death rates from accidents and air pollution major energy sources (fossil fuels, nuclear and biomass). Sovacool et al. (2016) assessed death rates from accidents from low-carbon energy sources (nuclear and renewables) based on historical records spanning the period 1990 to 2013.<p>When we try to combine the two analyses referenced earlier, one issue we encounter is that neither study includes both of the major nuclear accidents in its death rate figure: Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) was published before the Fukushima disaster in 2011; and Sovacool et al. (2016) only look at death rates since 1990, and therefore do not include the 1986 Chernobyl accident. We have therefore reconstructed the death rate for nuclear to include both of these accidents.<p>For Chernobyl, there are several death estimates. We rely on the estimate published by the World Health Organization (WHO) – the most-widely cited figure – although this is considered to be too high by several researchers, including a later report by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR). The WHO estimates that 4000 people have, or will die, from the Chernobyl disaster. This includes the death of 31 people as a direct result of the disaster and those expected to die at a later date from cancers due to radiation exposure.<p>The disaster in Fukushima killed 574 people. In 2018, the Japanese government reported that one worker has since died from lung cancer as a result of exposure from the event. No one died directly from the Fukushima disaster. Instead, most people died as a result of evacuation procedures. According to Japanese authorities 573 people died due to the impact of the evacuation and stress.<p>To the death toll of history’s two nuclear disasters we have added the death rate that Markandya and Wilkinson (2007) estimated for occupational deaths, most from milling and mining. Their published rate is 0.022 deaths per TWh.<p>The sum of these three data points gives us a death rate of 0.07 deaths per TWh.<p>Full references to the underlying studies can be found here:<p>Sovacool, B.
