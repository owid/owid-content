Per capita estimates are calculated by dividing incomes by the number of household members.<br><br>Poverty indicators are obtained by using <a href='https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s366004.html'>Stata’s povdeco function</a>. Weights are set as the product between the number of household members (nhhmem) and the normalized household weight (hwgt). The function generates FGT(0) and FGT(1), headcount ratio and poverty gap index. After extraction, further data processing steps are done to estimate other poverty indicators using these values, population and poverty lines for absolute and relative poverty.	%	%	15;20;25;30;35	YlOrBr	Luxembourg Income Study (2023)	Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) Database, http://www.lisdatacenter.org (multiple countries; 1967-2021).
