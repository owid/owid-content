	Mean income or consumption (PIP data)	mean	Numeric	Mean income or consumption.\n\nDepending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nThe data is measured in international-$ at 2017 prices – this adjusts for inflation and for differences in the cost of living between countries.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years. A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries and metrics. In choosing which data points to drop, we try to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. As such, the exact approach varies somewhat across countries.\n\nIf you would like to see the original data with _all_ available income and consumption data points shown separately, you can do so in our [Incomes Across the Distribution - World Bank Data Explorer](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/incomes-across-distribution-wb?Indicator=Decile+thresholds&Decile=9+%28richest%29&Household+survey+data+type=Show+data+from+both+income+and+consumption+surveys&Period=Day&Show+breaks+between+less+comparable+surveys=true&country=ROU~CHN~BLR~PER).

	8th decile (PIP data)	decile8_thr	Numeric	The level of income or consumption per day below which 80% of the population falls.\n\nDepending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nThe data is measured in international-$ at 2017 prices – this adjusts for inflation and for differences in the cost of living between countries.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years. A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries and metrics. In choosing which data points to drop, we try to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible.

	8th decile (PIP data)	decile8_avg_year	Numeric	The mean income or consumption per year within the 8th decile (tenth of the population).\n\nDepending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).\n\nNon-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.\n\nThe data is measured in international-$ at 2017 prices – this adjusts for inflation and for differences in the cost of living between countries.\n\nNOTES ON HOW WE PROCESSED THIS INDICATOR\n\nFor most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years. A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.\n\nIn most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries and metrics. In choosing which data points to drop, we try to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. As such, the exact approach varies somewhat across countries.\n\nIf you would like to see the original data with _all_ available income and consumption data points shown separately, you can do so in our [Incomes Across the Distribution - World Bank Data Explorer](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/incomes-across-distribution-wb?Indicator=Decile+thresholds&Decile=9+%28richest%29&Household+survey+data+type=Show+data+from+both+income+and+consumption+surveys&Period=Day&Show+breaks+between+less+comparable+surveys=true&country=ROU~CHN~BLR~PER).

The estimations follow the methodology available in LIS, Key Figures and DART platform.\n\nWe obtain after tax income by using the disposable household income variable (`dhi`).\n\nWe estimate before tax income by calculating the sum of income from labor and capital (variable `hifactor`), cash transfers and in-kind goods and services from privates (`hiprivate`) and private pensions (`hi33`). We do this only for surveys where tax and contributions are fully captured, collected or imputed.\n\nWe convert income data from local currency into international-$ by dividing by the [LIS PPP factor](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/resources/ppp-deflators/), available as an additional database in the LISSY platform.\n\nWe top and bottom-code incomes by replacing negative values with zeros and setting boundaries for extreme values of log income: at the top Q3 plus 3 times the interquartile range (Q3-Q1), and at the bottom Q1 minus 3 times the interquartile range.\n\nWe equivalize incomes by dividing each household observation by the square root of the number of household members (nhhmem). Per capita estimates are calculated by dividing incomes by the number of household members.\n\nIncome shares and thresholds by decile are obtained by using [Stata’s sumdist function](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s366005.html). We set weights as the product between the number of household members (nhhmem) and the normalized household weight (hwgt) and the number of quantile groups as 10. We estimate threshold ratios, share ratios and averages by decile in Python after processing in the LISSY platform.	international-$ in 2017 prices	$		Greens	multiplyBy avg_p50_mi_pc 1	Luxembourg Income Study (2024)	Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) Database, http://www.lisdatacenter.org (multiple countries; June 2024).
